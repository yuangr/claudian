# Grok constraints

- Authentication is native: never automatically call ACP authenticate or persist xAI credentials. Preserve session identity across prompt/CLI/environment changes by reloading it after process replacement.
- Native fork requests omit system-prompt metadata. Load the child with the complete current replacement before its first prompt; mark configuration applied only after successful load.
- Keep Grok/xAI tools enabled except native plan entry/exit, which Claudian blocks without replacing native or user agent profiles. Preserve unknown tool data and native task names/payloads while adapting subagent presentation.
- Grok client-hook errors and timeouts fail open. Answer plan-hook callbacks with a native denial directly, including during cancellation; do not route them through user approval or throw on malformed callbacks.
- Explicit selected-model order supersedes the discovered default.
- Discover reasoning metadata through session-independent native queries or actual sessions, never a session created only for discovery. Keep stale device discovery on environment/CLI fingerprint changes while preserving native conversation identifiers.
- Do not rewrite native config, own BYOK endpoints, or source shell startup files.
- Grok discovers user runtime AGENTS.md natively. Claudian must not create, rewrite, suppress, or explicitly inject those files.
- Nonstandard xAI behavior requires sanitized native protocol evidence.
